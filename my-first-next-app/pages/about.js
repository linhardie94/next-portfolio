        <h1>About</h1>

        <h2>Who is Lindsay?</h2>
        <p>I was born in East London and grew up on the beach, then headed to UCT to study Applied Biology and Marine Biology.</p>
        <p>The move from small town to big city changed my life. It fueled my sense of curiosity and drove me towards a career in the fintech startup scene.</p>
        <p>I really love the process of learning new things and experiencing something new.</p>
        <p>I like to read, eat and spend time outside. A good book teaches me how to view life from another person's perspective. A new recipe teaches me how to keep trying, even when something goes wrong, and how individuals with different strengths come together to create something special. And a new adventure reminds me that there's so much data to collect.</p>
        <p>I have so much to learn and I can't wait.</p>

        <h2>Where have I worked?</h2>
        <h3>Root</h3>
        <p>I coordinate Product, Engineering and Design to rapidly evolve Root into a world-leading insurance platform. I enable the creation of effective experience for our clients by aligning shared business objectives.</p>
        <p>Additional responsibilities include fostering client empathy and communicating insights, prioritising workflows, sprints and projects, creating and maintaining momentum around shared objectives.</p>
        
        <h3>Truevo</h3>
        <p>With no existing Customer Insights function in place, I developed and ran the methodologies and feedback strategies. I was key to launching the Truevo Account, the company's first small business product, and testing it with our first customers.</p>
        <p>Additional responsibilities included setting up and running regular NPS and CSAT surveys, running product research interviews, surveys and product tests, running online experiments to validate marketing insights, and collecting and analysing all qual and quant feedback</p>
        
        <h3>Yoco</h3>
        <p>As marketing coordinator I increased Yoco's brand awareness by developing and implementing strategies for Employer Brand and New Media. That involved developing and implementing social media content plans for LinkedIn, collaborating with designers to create content, collaborating with the People team, Sales Team, Customer Engagement Team and New Region Development Team to create and enhance brand touch points for our customers, and developing and implementing internal communication plans for campaign launches.</p>
